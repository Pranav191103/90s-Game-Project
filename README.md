# Tilt Master 90s – Final Project (TECHIN 512)

This repository contains the required structure and documentation for Take-Home Assignment 4 and the Final Project.

## 📁 Repository Structure

### ✔ src/
Contains placeholder files for code implementation (main code will be added later).

### ✔ Documentation/
Contains both required diagrams:
- **System Block Diagram**
- **Circuit Diagram**

These diagrams represent the hardware layout and wiring of the device according to project specifications.

## 📌 Project Overview
Tilt Master 90s is a simple, reflex-based handheld game inspired by classic 90s electronic toys.  
The system uses:

- **Xiao ESP32-C3**
- **ADXL345 Accelerometer**
- **SSD1306 OLED Display**
- **Rotary Encoder**
- **NeoPixel LEDs**
- **LiPo Battery + Power Switch**

The player performs tilt-based moves within a time limit.  
Difficulty is selected using the rotary encoder.
